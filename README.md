# VoxDose
VoxDose is an open-source tool for vocal dose analysis. It computes SPL (dBA), fundamental frequency (F0), and vocal dose metrics (Dt, VLI, Dd, De, Dr) from calibrated voice recordings. Originally based on MATLAB code by Prof. Pasquale Bottalico and adapted into Python with a user-friendly GUI.
